# Image Segmentation Masterclass

This repository contains a comprehensive guide and implementation for Image Segmentation, focusing on various techniques and models used in the field. Image segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to partition an image into meaningful regions, often at the pixel level.

## Access the Notebook

The Image Segmentation Masterclass notebook is available on Google Drive as it was TOO BIG for Github. You can access it directly using the following link:

## Description

The Image Segmentation Masterclass notebook provides an in-depth tutorial on different segmentation methods, including classical approaches and deep learning-based techniques. This masterclass covers the entire pipeline from data preparation to model evaluation. Here, we explore traditional image segmentation methods such as thresholding, edge detection, and clustering-based segmentation. This section dives into deep learning approaches for segmentation, including architectures like U-Net, SegNet, and Mask R-CNN. Details on how to train the segmentation models, including setting up the training loop, loss functions, and optimizers. This section explains the metrics used to evaluate segmentation models, such as IoU, Dice coefficient, and pixel accuracy.
